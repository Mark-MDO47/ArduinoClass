# NOTES

## Connect the Arduino Nano
![alt text](https://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Arduino-Nano-Pinout.jpg "CircuitsToday.com picture of Arduino Nano")

The Arduino Nano uses a USB Mini-B female and thus needs a cord from your laptop with a USB Mini-B Male connector. If your laptop has a USB A connection then I have cords you can use; otherwise please provide your own method to connect to either Mini-B directly or to bridge the gap to the USB A connector on the cord I can provide. This USB connection provides both a serial port (for uploading and communication) and power/ground.

## Start with example program

## Add serial port messages

## Add loop counter and Button; display on serial port

## Resources
### Arduino Nano and ATMEGA 328P
We will be using Arduino Nano clones in our projects. You can ignore the following for our class; this is for follow-up by interested persons.

Lots of info on the Arduino Nano is found here (diagrams, not schematics)

The ATMEGA 328P chip used in the Arduino Nano is described here

Mapping the ports to the internal registers is described here

### "F" macro to save RAM

### My favorite Arduino clone - ESP32
