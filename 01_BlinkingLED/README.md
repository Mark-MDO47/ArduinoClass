### Arduino Nano and ATMEGA 328P
We will be using Arduino Nano clones in our projects. You can ignore the following for our class; this is for follow-up by interested persons.

Lots of info on the Arduino Nano is found here (diagrams, not schematics)
* https://www.circuitstoday.com/arduino-nano-tutorial-pinout-schematics

The ATMEGA 328P chip used in the Arduino Nano is described here
* http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/ATmega48A-PA-88A-PA-168A-PA-328-P-DS-DS40002061A.pdf

Mapping the ports to the internal registers is described here

### "F" macro to save RAM

### My favorite Arduino clone - ESP32
