## Introduction
This code is used for one Arduino Nano in a set of two Arduino Nanos in one build. This build is for the Christmas Tree WS2812B LEDs.

The code for the other Arduino Nano is connected to the DFRobot DF2301Q (SKU SEN0539-EN, https://www.dfrobot.com/product-2665.html). This device allows us to enter voice commands. It does not require nor use an internet connection; the processing is done locally. It transfers the voice-command pattern number to the other Arduino. This will be the **I2C** version:
