## Arduino IDE
[Top](#notes "Top")<br>
**It will be helpful to install the Arduino IDE on your laptop before the start of the class if you are planning to use your laptop to connect to the test systems during the class.**<br>At this time the latest version is 2.04 and can be installed on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.

If you have a Chromebook I have not found a way to install the latest version, but the older version 1.8.19 can be installed on modern Chromebooks and will work fine for this class. Search for "Legacy IDE (1.8.X)" in the above link. The following YouTube video describes this installation. NOTE: to play youtube and keep this tab open you must right-click the link and select to play in a new tab.

It is possible to use the "Arduino Cloud". This method is not used in this class.

## C and Cplusplus Languages used in Arduino IDE
[Top](#notes "Top")<br>
The Arduino IDE uses a variant of the C++ language. You can program in a C++ style or a C style. The code that we will use in this course will be quite straighforward and should be understandable if you know any computer language. One thing to note about C/C++: array indices start with zero.

## KiCad - optional
[Top](#notes "Top")<br>
I use the free schematic editor KiCad for capturing schematics. It can also do Spice simulations, PCB board layout, Gerber File generation, Bill of Materials --- the whole works!
- https://www.kicad.org/

This is not needed for the class but is a fantastic tool for those that are interested. See the larger KiCad discussion in the resources section for more details.

## Fritzing - optional
[Top](#notes "Top")<br>
I use the Fritzing tool **(costs about $10)** to generate depictions of our breadboard projects. This tool can also do simulations and can have a PCB board made with your breadboard project.

This is not needed for the class but is a fun tool for those that are interested. See the larger Fritzing and InkScape discussion in the resources section for more details.
