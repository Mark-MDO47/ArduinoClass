# NOTES

## Arduino IDE
It will be helpful to install the Arduino IDE on your laptop before the start of the class if you are planning to use your laptop to connect to the test systems during the class. At this time the latest version is 2.04 and can be installed on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.

If you have a Chromebook I have not found a way to install the latest version, but the older version 1.8.19 can be installed on modern Chromebooks and will work fine for this class. Search for "Legacy IDE (1.8.X)" in the above link. The following YouTube describes this installation.

It is possible to use the "Arduino Cloud". This method is not used in this class.

## KiCad (optional)
I use the free schematic editor KiCad for capturing schematics. It can also do Spice simulations, PCB board layout, Gerber File generation, Bill of Materials --- the whole works!

This is not needed for the class but is a fantastic tool for those that are interested.
