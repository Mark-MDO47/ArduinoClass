Some sounds used on this SD card were generated by me using eSpeak and some came from the sources below. Sounds may have been cut into pieces, altered, combined, etc.<br><br>
Sounds on this SD card have a naming convention to optimize use with the YX5200 module. These names do not correspond directly to the filenames listed below, which are the source file names for some of the sounds.<br><br>
The space sound is from the NASA Cassini mission representing radio emissions from Saturn: http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/space-audio/cassini/SKR1/<br><br>
Attribution of external sounds found (in whole or in part, possibly altered) on this SD card:<br><br>

The original eSpeak text to speech code and compiled versions can be found at http://espeak.sourceforge.net/<br>
A web implementation of eSpeak can be found here; it is great fun, and just one of many text-to-text and text-to-speech engines on the site. https://lingojam.com/RobotVoiceGenerator/<br>
